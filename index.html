        <p> A.S.S.E.T FOUNDATION <br/><br/>
          The 195th Birthday celebrations of P.T.Lee.Chengalwaraya Naicker, the founder of CN polytechnic college College, Vepery, Chennai-600007  were held on 10-4-23 at Golden jubilee hall situated in the college compound. <br/><br/>
        
          There were series of events right from the morning till evening ; The inauguration of a commercial complex in Rajaji Road, garlanding the statue of the founder in the college compound, conducting special poojas in the Temple situated within the college compound, spl medical camp conducted jointly by the Central Siddha Reasearch Institute, Tambaram and the Free Siddha Hospital run by the CNT Trust, special poojas conducted in Parthsarathyswamy Temple followed by lunch for 2000 people In the college compound.<br/><br/>

          Then the Birthday celebration meeting commenced by 2-30 PM wherein chairman of the Trust, some of the Trustees and some other dignitaries from different walks of life participated and delivered their speech.  <br/>
          The Chengelvaraya Naicker polytechnic College is located in a 15 acre land in Vepery and it was established in the year 1874. The founder, a real gentleman, had endowed majority of his properties to the Trust. <br/>
          And P.T.Lee CN Arts college (coed) was established in the same campus in the year 2021 and P.T.Lee CN college of Engineering Technology was also established in the same year in kanchipuram. <br/>
          They are also running a free Siddha dispensary, a higher secondary school and an orphanage for the destitute students in the same campus. <br><br>
          A.S.S.E.T Foundation has so far sponsored 25 students in P.T.Lee CN polytechnic college, 11 students in P.T.Lee CN Arts & Science college and 1 student in P.T.Lee college of Engng Technology. <br><br>
          
          The present chairman of the P.T.Lee. CN Trust is the retired Justice, Mr. PON KALAIARASAN. He was very particular about the Trustees of A.S.S.E.T Foundation to attend the function and on his insistence invitation was extended to A.S.S.E.T Foundation to participate in the proceedings. <br><br>
          
          The Secy and Treasurer were out of town. The managing Trustee and other Trustees were otherwise engaged. And as a Coordinator and Trustee, I somehow managed to attend the meeting by 4-30 PM. The moment I entered the Auditorium, both the principal of Polytechnic college and the Arts & Science college gave me a warm reception and provided a seat in the first row. And within ten minutes, they spoke few words in appreciation of the service rendered by the A.S.S.E.T Foundation. They called me on stage and the Chairman honoured me with a shawl. After a few minutes I took leave of them to discharge my other obligations. <br><br>
          
          P.T.Lee Chengelvaraya Naicker Trust is dedicated in its service in rendering education to the poor section of the society. The fees are comparatively very much less and I am given to understand that some of the poor category of students were offered their under graduation course for less than Rs.5000/- as fees per semester. The management till this day is very much dedicated to the principles of the founder. <br><br>
          
          A.S.S.E.T Foundation is very much fortunate to have sponsored the education of 37 students studying in the CN group of institutions and be a part of the activities of the said P.T.Lee CN Trust. <br><br>
          
          A.S.S.E.T Foundation always remembers the MCT friends who have been giving donations time and again to energise the activities of the Trust in fulfilling its motto “ Educate and Elevate”<br><br>
          
          We thank all the donors, friends and volunteers who keep engaging us to discharge our duties to the financially disadvantageous section of the society. <br><br>

        <p> A.S.S.E.T FOUNDATION <br/><br/>
          We are pleased to inform you that our ONLY beneficiary ( out of 99) studying CA has passed the final exam with 63% in the first attempt itself. She passed her foundation course with DISTINCTION and Intermediate with almost distinction. <br/><br/>

        Though hailing from economically very weaker family with stroke affected parents and looked after by paternal grand mother, she has been an outstanding student from school days ( M.Ct.Lady Muthiah Chettiar School, Lauder's Gate).<br/><br/>

        She joined B.Com.., morning class in Ethiraj College after +2.  <br/>
        But, courageously discontinued it from second year and joined Madras University Correspondence Course. That was a bold move. It gave her lot of quality time to concentrate on CA Foundation Course and finish it with flying colors...She did not ever turn back. <br/>
        We, A.S.S.E.T FOUNDATION are immensely proud that one of our beneficiaries ...her name is LATHA ( now revealed !) has overwhelmed us with her success story. <br/>
        Well wishers and Donors like you ONLY, made this sponsorship possible. With all humility we bow our heads to thank you for the continued support. </p>

        <h3>Educate & Elevate - Our Motto</h3>
      </div>
      
      <div class="service-explained">
        <p>
          "Service to Others" often is a less understood and less accomplished
          subject. With demographics in favour of our country - India has more
          than 50% of its population below the age of 25 and more than 65% below
          the age of 35, it is expected that in 2020, the average age of an Indian
          will be 29 years - the need for qualified educated citizens in our
          society cannot be over emphasized. However, it is an open fact that not
          many can afford quality higher education, owing to the less fortunate
          economic situation that they are in. It behoves on the other spectrum of
          people who are or have been fortunate enough to receive such education
          and achieve social status in life, to give back to the same society that
          they belong to.

          There are many benevolent hearts that wish to ignite the lives of people
          who are submerged in the darkness of ignorance. Please join us - let us
          handhold the deprived youth to take them to meritorious status.

          All human beings must strive to create wealth in the utmost ethical path
          by nurturing the elements around us. Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Ether -
          the major five elements must be preserved so well that they in turn
          protect humans and other living beings . The wealth so created should be
          deployed to enhance the quality of life within one’s own home,
          organisation and society.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          A.S.S.E.T Foundation truly believes that there is a philanthropist in
          every human being, whether rich or poor. We have seen several times the
          poorest of the poor share their food with another hungrier person. So
          the question is not if one would donate, but how would one choose the
          right channel to ensure that the donation reaches the really needy, and
          also seeds long-term benefits.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Education empowers, and elevates the quality of an individual, his home,
          the organisation he belongs to, and the society at large. And of all the
          wealth, education is the one that cannot be stolen. Donor interaction
          with A.S.S.E.T Foundation and help rendered to the needy students in
          their education process is depicted in the exhibit below:
