			<h4 class="conception-text">Conception:</h4>
			<p><span style="font-size:38px">T</span>he successful completion of the Golden Jubilee Celebration of the 1965 batch  of Sir. M. Ct. M. High School,Purasawakkam, Chennai – 600084, on December 26, 2015, started another discussion in a positive way.</p>
			<p>At this age, if some 80 school mates could get together for the joyous occasion through the untiring efforts of a few of our former colleagues 50 years after they finished schooling together, what would stop in reuniting themselves for the common good of the society at large? The question was easily posed but not easily answered. To rephrase it another way, the old batch mates had more questions than answers. Would it be possible to start up an organization for doing service to the society when most in the group were on the wrong side of 60 in terms of age? Would this venture remain sustainable? Would it call for seed money to start up a non profitable organization? What would be the legal and compliance requirements? Who would do the leg work when it comes running about to get things done? How would the group get some of the mates who are overseas based, involved? How and who would the group pass the baton to carry out the functions of such an endeavour?  </p>
			<div class="about-us-video">

			</div>	
			<p>Although not many questions could be answered in a known positive way, the resolve still remained intact. Some of the associates provided the initial money to get an organization started. Some promised to do all physical help. Some professionals undertook to do the necessary in terms of legal compliance and registration matters. The group, however, had a firm belief that this could be started and could be kept afloat. With the realization and clear foresight that public involvement is extremely important, the mates resolved to float the education charity as a Public Charitable Trust under the Indian Trust Act, 1882. </p>
			<p>With concerted efforts gaining momentum by the day, Assured Support for Student Education and Talent Foundation (A.S.S.E.T ) Trust was formed and registered at the Sub Registrar’s Office on March 10, 2016 with Registration Number 30/2016.</p>

      </div>
			<p>As soon as the trust was registered, a desire was expressed by all that it should start funding the educational needs of under privileged, meritorious, but monetarily challenged school finalists so that they could continue with their higher education. Accordingly, three students were chosen who met with the rigorous selection criteria set forth by the selection committee for awarding the scholarship. The Trustees are glad to report that A.S.S.E.T Foundation has been able to do it within three months of forming the trust, thanks to the generous contribution of the  well-wishers.</p>

					<li>A.S.S.E.T Foundation needs to be run by philanthropic minded people to stay afloat and carry on the objectives of the Trust in the foreseeable future.</li>
					<li>Public support – both financial and non-financial related- is extremely important for furtherance of the objectives.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Thus the need of public involvement and contribution as well as voluntary service to carry out our vision cannot be over emphasized.</p>
